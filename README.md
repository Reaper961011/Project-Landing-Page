# Project-Landing-Page

# Description:
Designing a Landing page based off of a template provided by The Odin Project, _Thanks Odin Project_. 
The Website is comprised of a nav [HeaderLogo,3Links], a header banner, content, a quote section, a hero section and a footer.

TOP has provided dummy Text however, I will attempt to make a business looking website or maybe something different. (by the time you are reading this, I should already be done)
This project is based off of HTML and CSS principles learnt on the Odin Project.
